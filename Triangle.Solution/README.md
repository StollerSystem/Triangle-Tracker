## Description

Triangle Tracker
Make a web page that allows the user to input the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns whether these sides form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle or if the sides cannot make a triangle at all. Here are the definitions of each possibility:

##Specs
Make a console app with a Triangle class.

-NOT a triangle: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side.

- input: 2, 2, 10
- output: Not a Triangle

- Equilateral: All sides are equal.

  - input: 5, 5, 5
  - output: Equilateral

- Isosceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal.

  - input: 5, 5, 11
  - output: Isosceles

- Scalene: No sides are equal.

  - input: 3, 4, 5
  - output: Scalene

- Use Console.ReadLine() to gather three numbers from the user.
  - input: "5 5 5" (string)
  - output: {5, 5, 5} (integers)

(side1 + side2) <= side3 || (side1 + side3) <= side2 || (side2 + side3) <= side1)
